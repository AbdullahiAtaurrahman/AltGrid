              Front-end developer learning modern web tools. I build simple,
              accessible interfaces and enjoy turning ideas into clean,
              responsive pages.

            <p>
              I'm currently following The Odin Project (Front-End route). I've
              completed several projects including a landing page, an
              interactive form, and an Etch-a-Sketch clone. I focus on HTML,
              CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, and I love learning by building.
